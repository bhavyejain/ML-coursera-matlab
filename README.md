This repository contains my solutions to the coding assignments of the Coursera Machine Learning course (Stanford University).

Linear-regression folder contains an implementation of the Linear Regression algorithm. (Week 2) 
The algorithm has been implemened by using Gradient Descent as well as the Normal Equation.
Feature scaling was also made use of.

Logistic-regression folder contains an implementation of the Logistic Regression algorithm. (Week 3)
The algorithm has been implemented in both, a regularized as well as an unregularized fasion.

Multi-class-classification-and-neural-networks folder contains my implementation of one-vs-all method
of multi class classification. As the second part of the exercise, there a code for the feedforward 
propagation algorithm for an already trained neural network for handwritten digit recognition.
